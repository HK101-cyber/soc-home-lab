# 🔵 SOC Home Lab — Enterprise SIEM Environment

> **Status:** 🔨 Active Build  
> **Lab Start Date:** May 2024  
> **Name:** Hammad Khan

## 🎯 Project Overview

A fully functional Security Operations Center (SOC) home lab built 
from scratch on virtual machines. This lab replicates an enterprise 
SOC environment using three industry-standard SIEM platforms.

**This is a living project** — detection rules, dashboards, and 
attack simulations are added continuously.
